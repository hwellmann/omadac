/**
 * Annotates a field or a setter method for injection of {@link GridMarshaller} resource. Grid marshaller
 * is provided to grid via {@link GridConfiguration}.
 * <p>
 * Marshaller can be injected into instances of following classes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GridTask}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridJob}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridSpi}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridLifecycleBean}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridUserResource @GridUserResource}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Here is how injection would typically happen:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements GridJob {
 *      ...
 *      &#64;GridMarshallerResource
 *      private GridMarshaller marshaller;
 *      ...
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * or
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements GridJob {
 *     ...
 *     private GridMarshaller marshaller = null;
 *     ...
 *     &#64;GridMarshallerResource
 *     public void setMarshaller(GridMarshaller marshaller) {
 *          this.marshaller = marshaller;
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * See {@link GridConfiguration#getMarshaller()} for Grid configuration details.
