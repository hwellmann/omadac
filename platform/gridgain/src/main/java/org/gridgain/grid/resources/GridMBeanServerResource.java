/**
 * Annotates a field or a setter method for injection of {@link MBeanServer} resource. MBean server
 * is provided to grid via {@link GridConfiguration}.
 * <p>
 * MBean serverr can be injected into instances of following classes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GridTask}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridJob}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridSpi}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridLifecycleBean}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridUserResource @GridUserResource}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Here is how injection would typically happen:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements GridJob {
 *      ...
 *      &#64;GridMBeanServerResource
 *      private MBeanServer mbeanSrv;
 *      ...
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * or
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements GridJob {
 *     ...
 *     private MBeanSever mbeanSrv = null;
 *     ...
 *     &#64;GridMBeanServerResource
 *     public void setMBeanServer(MBeanServer mbeanSrv) {
 *          this.mbeanSrv = mbeanSrv;
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * See {@link GridConfiguration#getMBeanServer()} for Grid configuration details.
