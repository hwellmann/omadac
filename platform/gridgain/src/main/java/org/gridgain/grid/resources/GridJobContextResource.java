/**
 * Annotates a field or a setter method for injection of {@link GridJobContext} instance.
 * It can be injected into grid jobs only.
 * <p>
 * Job context can be injected into instances of following classes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GridJob}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Here is how injection would typically happen:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements GridJob {
 *      ...
 *      &#64;GridJobContextResource
 *      private GridJobContext jobCtx;
 *      ...
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * or
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements GridJob {
 *     ...
 *     private GridJobContext jobCtx = null;
 *     ...
 *     &#64;GridJobContextResource
 *     public void setJobContext(GridJobContext jobCtx) {
 *          this.jobCtx = jobCtx;
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
