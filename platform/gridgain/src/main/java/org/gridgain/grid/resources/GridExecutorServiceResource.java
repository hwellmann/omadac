/**
 * Annotates a field or a setter method for injection of {@link ExecutorService} resource.
 * <tt>ExecutorService</tt> is provided to grid via {@link GridConfiguration}.
 * <p>
 * Executor service can be injected into instances of following classes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GridTask}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridJob}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridSpi}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridLifecycleBean}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridUserResource @GridUserResource}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Here is how injection would typically happen:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements GridJob {
 *      ...
 *      &#64;GridExecutorServiceResource
 *      private ExecutorService execSvc;
 *      ...
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * or
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements GridJob {
 *     ...
 *     private ExecutorService execSvc = null;
 *     ...
 *     &#64;GridExecutorServiceResource
 *     public void setExecutor(GridExecutorService execSvc) {
 *          this.execSvc = execSvc;
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * See {@link GridConfiguration#getExecutorService()} for Grid configuration details.
